                    Data Structures and Algorithms
                </summary>
                <p>
                    This course is about data structures; that is the methods of organizing large amounts of data.  It is also about algorithm analysis; that is, the estimation of the running time of algorithms.  Specifically, this course will cover fundamental abstract data types and their implementations as data structures, such as lists and trees, as well as asymptotic analyses of algorithms involving these data structures. Students will also learn about searching (dictionaries, priority queues, and hashing); sorting (internal and external); graphs and algorithms on graphs (shortest path, minimum spanning trees), and encryption.

                    DataBase Systems
                </summary>
                <p>
                    The course aims to introduce students to the understanding, concepts, design, implementation and use of database management systems (DBMSes) and databases (DBs). The DBMS part of the course involves understanding the approaches, techniques, models as well as the underlying database system architecture such as query planners, transaction, concurrency, security and recovery managers. Students will also learn models used at various levels – from conceptual to physical – including entity relationship (ER) diagrams, enhanced entity relationship (EER) diagrams, and unified modeling language (UML) diagrams. The various roles and users of database systems will also be explored. The course has a relational and SQL bias, but there will be some exploration of some noSQL databases (mongoDB, neo4j, etc). .

                <p>
                    This course will teach you to become familiar with the conventional methods for software development, introduce good development practises (eg creating javadoc documentation, naming and coding style conventions), the tools of the trade(eg use of version control systems), and how to collaborate on a software development team. Students will become acquainted with libraries to facilitate the development of common graphical desktop applications. Basic software engineering techniques will be heighted and practised in two separate group projects. (waterfall/phased and agile). Students will be introduced to the use of the MVC architecture, and while studying classes and object inheritance, will explore common design patterns (eg Singleton, Observer, Factory etc)
