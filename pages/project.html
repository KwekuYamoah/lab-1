                    Database Management System for KayaChild Care
                </summary>
                <p>
                    I implemented a DBMS for KayaChild Care as my Database Systems Project:
                    KayaChild Care is a nn-governmental organisation run by Rose Dood. The Care provides support to Kayayei mothers who cannot send their children to school and at the same tine go about their daily lives easily. The centre provides support for both mother and child. The functionalities of the DBMS I built includes;
                    <ul>
                        <li>The model retrieves information for both a mother and a child enrolled under the program.</li>
                        <li>
                            The model keeps records on cognitive, health, and nutrition data. To better track children’s holistic development at the centre.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The model retrieves data on children who need extra health care and have developmental gaps.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    Jamestown Challenge
                </summary>
                <p>
                   I participated in an Ashesi Design lab challenge that aimed at boosting tourist activities in Jamestown(British Accra). I was a team lead that lead primary investigations and interview. After the investigation process, my team and I were able to suggest some viable solutions that could help reshape Jamestown. The solutions suggested included, glass boat fishing, a canoe runway and augmented fishing experience.

                    Project Huffman: Data Structures and Algorithms Project
                </summary>
                <p>
                    For my Data Structures final project I lead my team to re-implement huffman's algorithm. Huffman's algorithm is a technique used as a compressor for sourced data and, the lossless transmission
                    between the transmitter and receiver. The Huffman logic is said to have an advantage over other algorithms due to it being practical, static, its execution speed, closeness to an optimum and its depiction using a “look-up” table.

                    Project Titanic: Intermediate Computer Programming Project

                    The goal of this project was for teams to implement a Galamsey Monitoring System. The system was to detect illegal mining activities in Ghana and spot the location based on the longitude and latitude of the event. For the part I implemented the Observatory class which helps register Galamsey Observatories across Ghana. For part two, I worked on building a UI version of the system using JavaFx and also built the database for the system.
